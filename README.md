`mindreader.py` requires [GameConqueror](https://github.com/scanmem/scanmem) files to run.
To install it on Ubuntu just run:
```bash
sudo apt install gameconqueror
```

Visualizer requires [GodotEngine](https://godotengine.org/download) to run. It is enough just to put the editor executable file in the project folder and run.
